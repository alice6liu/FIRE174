<p>With a growing digital presence in today’s society, there has been an increase in the use of online platforms which many people are using to their advantage in order to voice their opinions on important matters. As an avid music listener, I look up to artists that use their influence to promote a notable message. In this archive, I am honing in on specific ways that black musical artists have utilized digital spaces to fight for freedom and incorporate their voices into the growing movement of Black Lives Matter.</p>

<p>“Black Lives Matter” is an international activist movement stemming from the African American community, which strives to fight against the violence and systemic racism towards black people. Starting in 2013, three radical Black organizers created the #BlackLivesMatter project in response to the acquittal of Trayvon Martin’s murderer, George Zimmerman. This ideological and political intervention is an attempt to affirm Black humanity through the means of amplifying the names of those who have been misrepresented. Many measures have been taken to address these issues of anti-Black racism and state-sanctioned violence - most of which are taking place in online spaces. The Black Lives Matter hashtag had gained immense popularity in the Twitter realm with many prominent figures using it to express their thoughts on topics such as the concept of freedom outside and within the Black community. It has allowed conversations to spur and develop into well thought out debate.</p>

<p>Ever since there has been vast availability and accessibility to online spaces, communities have had the opportunity to declare their ideas of freedom and inclusivity to whoever wants to listen. In light of the Black Lives Matter movement, there has been a rise in political uproar from influencers. People with a following have the power to influence and connect with their audience. Black musical artists are known for creating works of art and clearly have the ability to showcase what they want their audience to feel through their words and lyricism.</p>
