<p>With a growing digital presence in todayâ€™s society, there has been an increase in the use of online platforms which many people are using to their advantage in order to voice their opinions on important matters. As an avid music listener, I look up to artists that use their influence to promote a notable message. In this archive, I am honing in on specific ways that black musical artists have utilized digital spaces to fight for freedom and incorporate their voices into the growing movement of Black Lives Matter.</p>
