      Yeah, yeah, yeah, go, go away<lb/>
      Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<lb/>
      Yeah, yeah, yeah, go, go away<supplied reason="clarification">In this opening scene, the guitarist and gospel choir are featured to represent the tradition of black music and art throughout American history. The choir represents unity to show that black people live together and die together in the fight against injustice. In the video, the guitarrist has a bag over his head and then <persName ref="DG">Childish Gambino</persName> executes him before the switch to the chorus.</supplied></p>

      Party just for free (yeah)<lb/>
      Girl, you got me dancin' (girl, you got me dancin', yeah)<lb/>
      Dance and shake the frame (ooh)<supplied reason="clarification">These lyrics draw a relationship between dancing, partying, and violence which make up entertainment and black life in America. In the video, <persName ref="DG">Gambino</persName> and a group of school children perform popular dances like the <supplied source="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t8Gies2Zps">"shoot"</supplied> and <supplied source="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI067xJHADc">"Roy Purdy dance"</supplied> while other people scatter in the background. This goes to show how social media is blinding people from real problems in America with entertainment trends.</supplied></p>

      <p>[Chorus: Childish Gambino]<lb/>
      This is America<lb/>
      Don't catch you slippin' now<lb/>
      Don't catch you slippin' now<lb/>

      Don't catch you slippin' now<lb/>
      Don't catch you slippin' now<lb/>
      Look what I'm whippin' now<supplied reason="clarification">The beat starts to become more aggressive. In the video, Gambino shoots someone and his body pose resembles an old <supplied source="https://blackpast.org/aah/jim-crow">Jim Crow caricature.</supplied>These scenes cover the gun violence epidemic in America and instances of police brutality. There is a point trying to be made that guns are treated with more respect than human lives in a scene wher the gun is placed gently on a red cloth.</supplied></p>

      <p>[Verse 1: Childish Gambino, Blocboy JB, Slim Jxmmi, Young Thug + 21 Savage]<lb/>
      This is America (skrrt, skrrt, woo)<lb/>
