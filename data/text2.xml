         <p>[Eyewitness account from Dorian Johnson:]<lb/>
           So now it was like the officer is pulling him inside the car and he's<lb/>
           trying to pull away. At no time the officer said that he was going<lb/>
           to do anything until he pulled out his weapon. His weapon was<lb/>
           drawn and he said, "I'll shoot you" or, "I'm going to shoot" and in<lb/>
           the same moment, the first shot went off. We looked down and<lb/>
           he was shot and there was blood coming from him. Then we took<lb/>
           off running</p>

         <p>[Bridge]
           Are we all alone, fighting on our own<lb/>
           Please give me a chance, I don't wannt dance<lb/>
           Something's got me down, I will stand my ground<lb/>
           Don't just stand around, don't just stand around</p>

         <p>[Eyewitness account from Dorian Johnson:]
           As we took off running I ducked and hid for my life, because I<lb/>
           was fearing for my life. I hid behind the first car I saw. My friend,<lb/>
           he kept running, and he told me to keep running because he<lb/>
           feared for me too. So as he was running the officer was trying to<lb/>
           get out of the car, and once he got out the car he pursued my<lb/>
           friend but his weapon was drawn. Now he didn't see any weapon<lb/>
           drawn at him or anything like that, us going for no weapon. His<lb/>
           weapon was already drawn when he got out the car. He shot<lb/>
           again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and<lb/>
           put his hands in the air, and start to get down, but the officer<lb/>
           still approached with his weapon drawn and he fired 7 more<lb/>
           shots and my friend died</p>
