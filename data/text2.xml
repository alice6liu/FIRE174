         <p>And I'm in denial
           And it don't take no x-ray to see right through my smile
           I know, I'd be on the go
           And it ain't no drink out there that can numb my soul
           No, no

           All we want to do is take the chains off
           All we want to do is break the chains off
           All we want to do is be free
           All we want to do is be free
           All we want to do is take the chains off
           All we want to do is break the chains off
           All we want to do is be free
           All we want to do is be free

           Can you tell me why every time I step outside
           I see my niggas die,
           Ooh, I'm letting you know
           That it ain't no gun they make that can kill my soul
           Oh, no

           All we want to do is take the chains off
           All we want to do is take the chains off
           All we want to do is be free
           All we want to do is be free
           All we want to do is take the chains off
           All we want to do is break the chains off
           All we want to do is be free
           All we want to do is be free

           Are we all alone fighting on our own
           Please give me a chance
           I don't wanna dance
           Something's got me down
           I will stand my ground,
           Don't just stand around
           Don't just stand around

           All we want to do is take these chains off
           All we want to do is break the chains off
           All we want to do is be free
           All we want to do is be free

           All we want to do is take these chains off
           All we want to do is break the chains off
           All we want to do is be free
           All we want to do is be free</p>
