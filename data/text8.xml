        <note>In this article, Sarah Florini explores the use of the Black American cultural tradition of "signifyin" as a means of performing racial identity online. Black users often perform their identities through displays of cultural competence and knowledge. Essentially, Twitter is used to extend Black oral culture through delploying figurative language and wordplay to convey many layers of meaning.</note>
